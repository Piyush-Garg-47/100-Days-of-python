## About the Challenge

The **100 Days of Python** challenge is designed to help me and others improve their Python skills through consistent daily practice. Each day consists of solving a coding problem, learning a new concept, or building a project using Python.

### Goals:
- Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Explore Python libraries and frameworks.
- Build interesting projects from scratch.
- Document daily progress to maintain accountability.

## Daily Progress

This section will be updated with links to daily activities as I complete them.

- **Day 1:** Basic Python syntax and control flow.
- **Day 2:** Introduction to functions and recursion.
- **Day 3:** Data structures in Python (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples).
- **Day 4:** Solving algorithmic problems (sorting and searching algorithms).

_...and so on up to 100 days._
